no Claude needed per run.
  1. Reuse the saved ERP session if alive; otherwise auto-login (fresh OTP).
  2. Extract the full notice board via a real headless browser (Playwright).
  3. Diff against previously-seen notice IDs (state committed back to the repo).
  4. Rebuild all 4 PDF documents + docs/notices.json with the latest data,
